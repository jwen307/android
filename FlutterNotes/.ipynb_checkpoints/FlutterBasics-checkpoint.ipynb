    "## Widgets\n",
    "Widgets are the key components of the UI framework. Each widget describe what the view should be give the current state and configuration. Each time the state changes the widget rebuilds itself to reflect the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Subclasses of Widgets\n",
    "1) StatelessWidget: widgets that don't change state. Everything inside the widget is predefined\n",
    "2) StatefulWidget: widgets whose content changes depending on the state\n",
    "\n",
    "A widget uses the build() function to describe itself using lower-level widgets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common widgets:\n",
    "- Text: a textbox\n",
    "- Row,Column: allows you to create layouts in the horizontal and vertical direction\n",
    "- Stack: allows you to place widgets on top of each other, then position them relative to an edge of the stack.\n",
    "- Container: a rectangular visual element which you can decorated with BoxDecoration. Pretty much a section which you can put other widgets in. Can define margins, padding, background.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical Setup\n",
    "The most basic function is runApp(). This calls the widget that you specify in the parameters to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Start of every app"
